## Introduction

Anti-Power enhances the Antigravity Sidebar and Manager window by applying patches that provide features such as Mermaid rendering, Math formula rendering, one-click copy, table color fixes, and font size/width adjustments. We hope to continuously improve the experience through community collaboration. Issues and Pull Requests are welcome.
